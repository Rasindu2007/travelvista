    <p><b>Athugala Rock Temple</b> obtained its name as the stone is elephant appearance and is 325 meters high. The locals in the vicinity myth that the rock has formed due to animals turning into rocks inadequate to withstand the harsh dryness. 
        There is a temple on the summit of the rock and a giant Samadhi Buddha statue overlooking the <b>city of Kurunegala.</b> However, there is a temple on the top of the cliff, and people from many faiths visit the temple to relish the hike and the adventurous expedition towards the top of the peak. 
        You could use the stairs to reach the top of the mountain or use the vehicle to climb up. 
        Hiking your route to the top of the hill is more pleasant than using a car to reach the top. 
        Walking towards the top of the mountain is favoured by many people. 
        The most suitable time to start hiking up the rock is during or after sunset, giving a panoramic view of Kurunegala city.
